# 1. Introduction

Ensuring a robust security posture in cloud-based applications requires the capability to trace and automatically respond to security events. By diligently monitoring key
activity metrics, architects can identify potentially malicious behavior early on, allowing for timely and appropriate responses. This proactive approach, paired with effective alerting systems, creates an autonomous feedback loop that keeps cloud administrators informed and able to mitigate risks before they escalate into serious incidents. This repository explores the integration of AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, and other services to enhance security monitoring and automated responses within an AWS environment.
